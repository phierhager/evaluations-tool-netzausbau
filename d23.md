**Project:** PhyLFlex (Physics-based Learning Energy Management)

**Responsible:** HAW Landshut (HAWL)
**Participating Partners:** TUM, ÜZW, SAG
**Version:** 1.0 (Final Concept)

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the conceptual framework for the **Grid Evaluation Tool** developed within AP 2.2. Its primary purpose is to quantitatively assess the impact of different flexibility measures on the distribution grid.

The tool serves as the central **Economic Validator**. It strictly separates physical grid facts from economic decisions. It imports raw physical indicators from the grid simulation (AP 3) and applies a "Costing Logic" to determine the optimal balance between Grid Expansion (CAPEX) and Flexibility Intervention (OPEX).

This deliverable also includes the **Catalog of Measures (Maßnahmenkatalog)**, defining the specific interventions to be evaluated.

## 2. Catalog of Measures (Maßnahmenkatalog)

The measures are categorized by their operational nature: market incentives vs. direct interventions.

### 2.1 Category A: Market-Based & Indirect Measures

*Measures that influence the load profile *before* the grid simulation runs.*

* 
**Measure A1: Dynamic Electricity Tariffs (§ 41a EnWG)** 


* **Description:** GEMS optimizes locally against a dynamic price vector.
* **Evaluation:** Does this purely financial optimization accidentally cause grid peaks?


* **Measure A2: Time-of-Use Tariffs**
* **Description:** Static high/low tariff windows.



### 2.2 Category B: Grid-Side & Direct Measures

*Measures that react *during* the grid simulation to prevent failure.*

* 
**Measure B1: § 14a EnWG Dimming (Curtailment)** 


* **Description:** Forced throttling of flexible loads (SteuVE) when voltage/trafo limits are violated.
* **Fact Generated:** `curtailed_energy_kwh` (Energy requested but denied).


* 
**Measure B2: Physical Reinforcement** 


* **Description:** Upgrading cables or transformers.
* **Fact Generated:** `overloaded_lines_km` (Length of cables exceeding capacity).

## 3. Evaluation Tool Concept (The Balancer)

The tool is designed as a **Decision Engine**. It reads "Pure Facts" from the grid simulation and calculates the "Total Cost of Ownership" for the grid operator.

### 3.1 Interface: "Pure Facts" Schema

The Grid Simulation (AP 3) must export the physical state of the grid for every timestep in the following standardized CSV format. The simulation does not calculate costs; it reports physical violations and actions taken.

```csv
timestamp, min_voltage_v, max_trafo_load_pct, overloaded_lines_km, curtailed_energy_kwh

```

**Column Definitions (The Facts):**

1. **`min_voltage_v`**: The lowest nodal voltage in the entire grid. (Physical Fact).
2. **`max_trafo_load_pct`**: The peak utilization of the transformer. (Physical Fact).
3. **`overloaded_lines_km`**: The total length of cables operating above their thermal limit or causing voltage drops < 207V. (Physical Fact).
* *Note:* If the simulation logic *fails* to stabilize the grid via dimming (e.g., base load is too high), this number will be > 0.


4. **`curtailed_energy_kwh`**: The amount of energy the simulation *successfully* suppressed via §14a to keep the grid stable. (Operational Fact).

### 3.2 Evaluation Logic: The Cost Balancing Model

The Evaluation Tool reads the facts and applies unit costs to determine the strategy.

**Cost Component 1: Virtual CAPEX (Hardware Cost)**
Calculated when the grid physically fails (`min_voltage_v < 207` or `overloaded_lines_km > 0`).

* *Logic:* "The simulation failed to stabilize the grid. We MUST build hardware."
* *Formula:* `CAPEX = (overloaded_lines_km * €80,000) + (Trafo_Upgrade * €25,000)`

**Cost Component 2: Intervention OPEX (Flexibility Cost)**
Calculated when the grid is stable but required intervention (`curtailed_energy_kwh > 0`).

* *Logic:* "The grid is safe, but we interrupted users. We must pay for this flexibility."
* *Formula:* `OPEX = curtailed_energy_kwh * Flexibility_Penalty_€`

### 3.3 The "Balancing" Output

The tool aggregates these costs over a simulation year to produce the final Project KPIs:

1. **Grid Resilience:** Did we avoid blackouts? (Are there unhandled voltage violations?)
2. **Economic Efficiency:** `Total_Cost = CAPEX (Construction) + OPEX (Curtailment)`.
* *Goal:* Minimize Total_Cost.
* *Insight:* Is it cheaper to build a new cable (High CAPEX) or to curtail users every day (High OPEX)?

## 4. Benchmark KPIs & Translation Logic

The tool translates the scientific metrics from D2.2 into the practical cost KPIs derived above.

| Scientific Metric (D2.2) | Practical Translation | Project KPI (Tool Output) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Peak-to-Average Ratio** | Determines transformer sizing. | **Trafo Utilization / Upgrade Cost** |
| **Line Loading %** | Determines cable sizing. | **Grid Reinforcement Cost (CAPEX)** |
| **Energy Not Served (ENS)** | The volume of dimming required. | **Intervention Cost (OPEX)** |
| **Voltage Deviation** | Quality of Service metric. | **Compliance Flag (Pass/Fail)** |

## 5. Conclusion

This architecture ensures a strict separation of concerns:

1. **Grid Simulation (AP 3):** Objective Reporter. Reports "What happened?" (Voltage dropped, Energy was cut).
2. **Evaluation Tool (AP 2.2):** Subjective Auditor. Reports "What does it cost?" (Construction vs. Compensation).

This allows the project to update unit prices (e.g., if copper becomes expensive) without re-running the complex physical simulations.
